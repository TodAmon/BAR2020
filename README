For the paper "Creating Human Readable Path Constraints from Symbolic Execution"

Be sure to install angr and the logic synthesis tool SIS.

This code uses sis 1.3, downloaded via a link from:
http://cs.columbia/edu/~cs6861/sis/sis/html

Section II-A, III-B (results for II-A)
   cat sub1or2.c
   objdump -M intel -d sub1or2
   python show_constraint_for_sub1or2.py

Section II-B, III-B (results for II-B)
   cat readtowrite.c
   python show_constraint_for_readtowrite.py

Section II-C, III-C:
  cat authentication.c
  cat authentication.eqn
  python show_constraint_for_authentication.py
  ~/sis1.3/bin/sis -c \
    "full_simplify; decomp -g; read_library authentication.genlib; map" \
    -T eqn -t eqn authentication.eqn 

Logic synthesis for simplification et.al.:

This work is ongoing and the files in this repository reflect the research state prior to the BAR
conference.  There is a lot of new work, but it has not been publicly released yet.
